# Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I built this project in hopes of learning what web developers might be doing! I learnt so many new things that I never knew how to do before, like, using HTML, using JavaScript, using CSS and Git! I can understand now how they all work together so well, you can really create amazing things with it. 

I loved how intricate all the languages I used could become, especially JavaScript. I am really looking forward to creating a lot more things!
